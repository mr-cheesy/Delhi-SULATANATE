<div><P>The Tomara Rajputs lost to the Chauhans ( also known as Chahamanas) in the middle of the 12th century at Ajmer. The Chauhans of Ajmer formed part of the feudatories of the Gurjara Pratiharas community. They fought the Battle of Rajasthan to save them from the Islamic conquests. After the weakening of the Prathiharas, the Chauhans demanded autonomous status for themselves. Ajmer was founded by the King of the Chauhan dynasty Sakambhari Ajay Raj Chauhan. The successor of Ajayraj Chauhan, Vigraharaj expanded the territory and seized Delhi. Delhi was a commercial hub and an important city. Before Delhi was captured by the Chauhans, it was the capital city of the Tomara Rajputs Many merchants and visitors came to Delhi. Delhi was, minted coins of Delhi were widely circulated. This city evolved itself under the regimes of the Tomaras Rajputs and Chauhans. This made Delhi an attractive option for different dynasties. The growing importance of the city and the weakening of the Tomaras Rajputs led to the capture of the city by the Chauhans of Ajmer. This further paved the way for future conquests of Delhi and ultimately leading to the Delhi Sultanate.</P></div>

<div><P>The Delhi Sultanate, or the Sultanate of Delhi, was a Muslim empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent during the period of Medieval India, for 320 years (1206–1526).Following the invasion of South Asia by the Ghurid dynasty, five unrelated heterogeneous dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–1290), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414),the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). It covered large swaths of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as well as some parts of southern Nepal.</div></P>

<div><P>The foundation of the Sultanate was laid by the Ghurid conqueror Muhammad Ghori who routed the Rajput Confederacy led by Ajmer ruler Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192 near Tarain, after suffering a reverse against them earlier.As a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one among a number of principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori, including Yildiz, Aibak and Qubacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves.After a long period of infighting, the Mamluks were overthrown in the Khalji revolution, which marked the transfer of power from the Turks to a heterogeneous Indo-Muslim nobility.Khalji and Tughlaq rule saw a new wave of rapid Muslim conquests deep into South India.The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent under Muhammad bin Tughluq.This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal and Bahmani Sultanates breaking off.In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.</div></P>

<div><P>The establishment of the Sultanate drew the Indian subcontinent more closely into international and multicultural Islamic social and economic networks.(as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language and Indo-Islamic architecture),being one of the few powers to repel attacks of the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate) and for enthroning one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultan, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.Bakhtiyar Khalji's annexations involved a large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples (contributing to the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal),and the destruction of universities and libraries. Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture there.</div></P>
